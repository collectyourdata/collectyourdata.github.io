<p>Collect Your Data is a place where you can work with others, or use what others have created, to gather information
from devices and then have the data posted into analytical software to investigate and analyze (and play with). This first
started out by me wanting to capture the GPS coordinates on my iPhone to then analyze and play with. I could view my location
with Google and Apple iPhone Apps but I wanted to do more with the data and also have the data available to use for
whatever else I thought of in the future.</p>
