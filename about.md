<p>I have used analytical software for over 6 years in my professional career and became so interested that I started using it at home. It first started out by having my NAS sending log data into Splunk then moved into my router and switches sending log data into Splunk. This then started me down the path to have the GPS coordinates of my iPhone Splunkâ€™d so that I could then analyze and play with. I could view my location with Google and Apple iPhone Apps but I wanted to do more with the data and also have the data available to use for whatever else I thought of in the future. After discussions with Bertus, this opened up even more to be in a general sense of ways to collect your data. Collecting and analyzing data is something I enjoy and have fun with, whether it be in my professional career or personally at home.</p>
